# Test task found in internet
## Motivation

Aviasales test task for frontend devs. Recommended framework to perform this task is React.
Anyone is allowed to use other tools for development. Hence, I also used Redux as a state management library.

P.S. it could've been done by react's own state, but my main task was to dive deep into redux and get more experience with it.

To run this project, install npm and npm start.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
